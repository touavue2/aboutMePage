I like tennis, chess, and working out. I'm not a sweet person prefer things that are unsweetened. I like spicy and bitter food because I ate most of them majority of my life. My favorite colors are black and orange. Pretty obvious with the background color. Slow tempo music makes me focus and sometimes when I focus too much, I get angry. Kinda weird because I focus better whenever I'm angry.";
